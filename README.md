## About me
Mobile and Web Developer focused on React Native, React, TypeScript, and Next.js. Passionate about creating innovative and impactful solutions that make users' lives easier.

I am currently pursuing a degree in Systems Analysis and Development and have had enriching experiences as a freelancer at G-Dev Society, where I developed interfaces using React, React Native, and TypeScript. My journey also includes an intensive six-month bootcamp by Santander Academy, specializing in hybrid mobile development with Flutter.

I am a dedicated and disciplined professional, always seeking new opportunities to learn and grow. My key skills include:

Mobile and Web Development using React, React Native, and TypeScript;
Experience with projects using Next.js;
Consuming and manipulating API data in React/React Native projects.
In addition to development, I am an enthusiast of volleyball, both in practice and as a spectator. This passion for the sport teaches me the importance of teamwork, discipline, and the constant pursuit of improvement.

I am always open to new connections and opportunities that can contribute to my professional growth and the development community's evolution!
